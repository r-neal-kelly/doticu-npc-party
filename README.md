# doticu-npc-party
A follower framework for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

## Features:
- the power to enlist any humaniod npc (other creatures may come later)
- the ability to clone any humaniod npc (to avoid conflicts with other scripts)
- every member can be made to settle in another part of the game world
- any member can be made completely immobile, so they never go anywhere
- a comprehensive dialogue menu to manage each individual member
- an exhaustive MCM menu to manage all members and settings

## Requires:
- [Skyrim SE 1.5.97+](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/)
- [SKSE 2.0.17+](https://skse.silverlock.org/)

(Some older versions of the above may work with my mod, but they are not supported.)
